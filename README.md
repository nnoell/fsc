FSC - File System Cyberspace
============================

**FSC** is an file system viewer that uses `OpenGL` to display the information as you where in cyberspace. It uses the following external libraries which are already included in the project:

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org): OpenGL library for creating windows, contexts, surfaces, and receiving input and events.
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de): OpenGL loader generator sources.
- [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html): OpenGL mathematics headers.
- [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org): Library for font rendering.

The project is still under construction...
